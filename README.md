### DevOps Roadmap

  * The following path is opinionated. You can find alternative paths in [ Coming soon....]
  * Do NOT attempt to learn everything, especially if you are a complete beginner (the burnout will make you regret you ever heard the word DevOps)
  * Learn enough to say "Hey, I know what is DevOps and I can build anything out of it 😎". You can learn everything else by demand or when you feel ready

#### The must list

Topic | What to learn | Alternatives | Description
:------|:------|:------|:------:
Version Control | [Git](./Git/) | - | Version Control is used everywhere and Git is the leading version control technology
Programming | At least one programming language | None. Don't settle for learning only shell scripting  | Anyone who practice DevOps should know programming to some extent
Operating System | [Linux](./Linux/) | Other distribution of Linux :D | Operating Systems is another must when it comes to DevOps
Protocols | DHCP, UDP, TCP, HTTP, SSH | Not as an alternative, you can simply learn later: NFS, NTP, FTP | Learn how these protocols work and what they are used for
Applications | Web Server, Load Balancer, Cache, Database | | Learn how they work and try out some implementations (e.g. MySQL for databases and httpd for web servers)
[System Design](https://github.com/bregman-arie/system-design-notebook) | Availability, Reliability, Scalability, Performance | Learn how to design infrastructure and systems

The second must list :)
Seriously though, don't try to master everything in this list and start with something that you are interested in. The order has no meaning in this case.

## Interactive practice and learning sites

Learning by doing proved to be a very effective way to learn new things. If you are at a point where you don't feel comfortable enough to do it by yourself and you look for some guidance, the following sites might assist you

Name | Description
:------|:------:
[Kodekloud Engineer](https://www.kodekloud-engineer.com/) | Perform real tasks by working in a fictional organization | 
[QWIKLBAS](https://www.qwiklabs.com) | AWS, GCP, ect | 
[Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) | Docker Lab | 
[Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/) | Kubernetes Lab |

## Community

Another great way to learn is to learn from the experience of others. For that, the are some excellent DevOps communities.

Name | Comments
:------|:------:
[Reddit DevOps](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops) | Reddit DevOps Community 
[Linkedin DevOps](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2825397) | Linkedin DevOps Community
